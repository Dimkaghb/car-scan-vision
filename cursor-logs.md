# CarVision Development Log

## Project Overview
CarVision is a taxi booking application with dual interfaces for Passengers and Drivers. The application includes car scratch detection functionality for drivers using Roboflow API.

## Current Session - Driver/Passenger Interface Separation

### Goal
Implement role-based interface separation where:
- Passengers continue using existing taxi booking interface
- Drivers get a completely different dashboard with car scratch detection
- Enhanced driver registration with image upload and processing

### Technical Requirements
1. Role-based routing after authentication
2. Driver dashboard with car inspection tools
3. Roboflow API integration for scratch detection
4. Enhanced driver registration form
5. Role-aware navigation components

### Progress Log
- ✅ Created comprehensive implementation plan
- ✅ Set up cursor-logs.md for development tracking
- ✅ Implemented role-based routing system
- ✅ Created Driver Dashboard with complete interface
- ✅ Built car scratch detection system with Roboflow API integration
- ✅ Implemented image upload component with drag-and-drop support
- ✅ Created detection results display with confidence scoring
- ✅ Added role-aware navigation (different buttons for drivers vs passengers)
- ✅ Implemented database service for inspection data management
- ✅ Enhanced registration form with all required fields

### Implementation Complete ✅
All planned features have been successfully implemented:

#### 🚗 **Driver Interface**
- Completely separate dashboard from passenger interface
- Car inspection system with image upload
- Real-time scratch detection using Roboflow API
- Inspection history with database persistence
- Driver-specific navigation and controls

#### 🚕 **Passenger Interface**
- Existing taxi booking functionality preserved
- Map interface for ride requests
- Passenger-specific navigation

#### 🔧 **Technical Features**
- Role-based authentication and routing
- Roboflow API integration for scratch detection
- Database storage for inspection results
- Real-time image processing with confidence scoring
- Responsive UI with loading states and error handling
- **NEW**: Multi-step driver onboarding system

### Latest Update - Driver Onboarding System ✅

#### 📋 **New Onboarding Flow for Drivers**
- **Step-by-step registration**: 4-step process with progress indicator
- **Personal Information**: Name and surname collection
- **Driver License**: License number with privacy notice
- **Experience**: Text area for driver experience description
- **Car Image**: Photo upload with camera/gallery options

#### 🎨 **UI/UX Features**
- **Progress bar**: Shows current step (e.g., "Шаг 2 из 5 (40%)")
- **Clean design**: Matches the provided reference image
- **Mobile-friendly**: Camera capture and gallery selection
- **Validation**: Real-time form validation with error messages
- **Examples**: Pre-written examples for experience field

#### 🔒 **Smart Flow Logic**
- **New drivers**: Automatically redirected to onboarding after registration
- **Existing drivers**: Skip onboarding if already completed
- **Protected access**: Cannot access dashboard until onboarding is done
- **Privacy notice**: Clear messaging about document handling

### 🔧 Storage Issue Resolution ✅

#### **Problem Identified:**
- Supabase storage bucket `driver-assets` doesn't exist by default
- Image uploads were failing with "Bucket not found" error

#### **Solutions Implemented:**
1. **Automatic fallback**: Images now use base64 encoding if storage fails
2. **Auto-bucket creation**: Service attempts to create bucket automatically
3. **Setup utilities**: Added manual setup tools for administrators
4. **Graceful degradation**: Users can complete onboarding even if storage is unavailable

#### **Files Added:**
- `src/utils/setupStorage.ts` - Storage setup utilities
- `src/components/admin/StorageSetup.tsx` - UI for storage management

### 🗃️ Database Schema Issue Resolution ✅

#### **Problem Identified:**
- Missing database columns: `driver_experience` and `onboarding_completed`
- Onboarding failing with "Could not find column" error

#### **Solutions Implemented:**
1. **Graceful fallback**: System works even with missing columns
2. **Automatic retry**: Falls back to minimal data if schema mismatch
3. **Smart detection**: Checks basic fields to determine onboarding status
4. **Migration script**: SQL migration provided for proper schema update

#### **Files Added:**
- `database_migration.sql` - Database schema migration
- `SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md` - Complete setup guide

### 🔄 Onboarding Persistence Issue Resolution ✅

#### **Problem Identified:**
- Existing drivers who completed onboarding were being asked to fill the form again
- Inconsistent onboarding status checking across the application

#### **Solutions Implemented:**
1. **Smart onboarding detection**: Checks both `onboarding_completed` flag and essential driver data
2. **Consistent utilities**: Created centralized functions for onboarding status checks
3. **Proper login flow**: New registrations go to onboarding, existing users go to dashboard
4. **Fallback mechanism**: Works even without `onboarding_completed` column

#### **Files Added:**
- `src/utils/onboardingUtils.ts` - Centralized onboarding status utilities

### 📱 Mobile-Responsive Map Page Implementation ✅

#### **Features Implemented:**
1. **Mobile-First Design**: Complete responsive redesign of the map page
2. **Sliding Sidebar**: Touch-friendly sidebar that slides in/out with smooth animations
3. **Bottom Sheet Modals**: Car details displayed as mobile-native bottom sheets
4. **Touch-Optimized Controls**: Larger buttons and touch-friendly interactions
5. **Glassmorphism UI**: Modern backdrop-blur effects and gradient designs
6. **Auto-Close Behavior**: Smart sidebar auto-close after user actions
7. **Mobile Header**: Clean header with hamburger menu for mobile navigation

#### **Mobile UI Enhancements:**
- **Responsive Sidebar**: Slides in from left as overlay on mobile, fixed on desktop
- **Mobile Header**: Clean top bar with menu toggle and title
- **Quick Actions Bar**: Bottom action bar with "Book Ride" and "My Location" buttons
- **Enhanced Zoom Controls**: Larger, touch-friendly zoom buttons positioned for mobile
- **Mobile Car Modals**: Bottom sheet design with swipe handle and backdrop
- **Gradient Buttons**: Modern gradient designs for CTAs
- **Touch Feedback**: Hover and active states optimized for touch devices

#### **Technical Implementation:**
- **useIsMobile Hook**: Consistent mobile detection across components
- **Responsive Layout**: Flexbox-based layout that adapts to screen size
- **CSS Transitions**: Smooth animations for sidebar and modal states
- **Backdrop Blur**: Modern glassmorphism effects using backdrop-blur
- **Z-Index Management**: Proper layering for overlays and modals
- **Touch Events**: Optimized for mobile interaction patterns

#### **Files Modified:**
- `src/pages/mainmap.tsx` - Main map component with mobile responsiveness
- `src/components/RideBookingSidebar.tsx` - Mobile-responsive sidebar
- `src/components/CarModal.tsx` - Mobile bottom sheet modal design

### API Integration Details
- **Roboflow Endpoint**: `https://detect.roboflow.com/car-scratch-xgxzs-yozzg/3?api_key=c57FoTijFtYh0tKwLM1C`
- **Method**: POST with base64 encoded image data
- **Response Format**: JSON with inference_id, processing time, image dimensions, and predictions array
